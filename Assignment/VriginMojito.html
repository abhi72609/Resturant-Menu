        <p>
            A virgin mojito is a refreshing non-alcoholic drink made with mint, lemon, and soda. To prepare, take a tall glass and add 8–10 fresh mint leaves, 2 lemon wedges, and 1–2 teaspoons of sugar (or honey). Lightly muddle them with a muddler or spoon to release the lemon juice and mint flavor, but don’t crush the mint too much. 
        </p>

            Add plenty of ice cubes, pour in ½ cup of chilled soda water (or sparkling water), and mix gently. You can also add a splash of Sprite or 7UP if you like it sweeter. Garnish with a lemon slice and a sprig of mint on top. Serve immediately for a cool, fizzy, and refreshing drink.
