            To make veg soya biryani, first wash and soak 1 ½ cups of basmati rice for 30 minutes, then cook it in boiling water with a little salt, bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon until about 80% done, then drain and set aside. Meanwhile, soak 1 cup of soya chunks in hot water for 15 minutes, squeeze out excess water, and keep them ready. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil and 1 tablespoon of ghee in a pan, add whole spices like cumin, bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon, then sauté 2 sliced onions until golden.

            Add 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste and cook briefly, then add 2 chopped tomatoes and 2 slit green chilies, cooking until the tomatoes soften. Mix in ½ teaspoon turmeric, 1 teaspoon red chili powder, and 1 ½ teaspoons biryani masala, then add 1 cup mixed vegetables (like carrot, beans, peas, and potato) along with the soaked soya chunks. Stir in 2 tablespoons curd, salt, and a handful each of coriander and mint leaves, cooking until the veggies are almost done.

            For layering, spread half of the cooked rice in a heavy-bottom pan, then add all the soya-veg masala, and finally top with the remaining rice. Garnish with more coriander, mint, fried onions if you like, and drizzle some ghee or saffron milk. Cover tightly and cook on low heat for 15–20 minutes to let the flavors blend together. Fluff gently before serving and enjoy the biryani hot with raita, papad, or salad.
