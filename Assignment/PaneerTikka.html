            Paneer tikka is a delicious Indian starter made by marinating paneer cubes and vegetables in a spiced yogurt mixture and then grilling them. To prepare, cut 250–300 grams of paneer into medium cubes and also chop 1 onion, 1 capsicum, and 1 tomato into similar-sized pieces. In a bowl, mix ½ cup thick curd (yogurt) with 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste, 1 teaspoon red chili powder, ½ teaspoon turmeric, 1 teaspoon cumin powder, 1 teaspoon garam masala, 1 teaspoon coriander powder, salt to taste, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon oil.

            Add the paneer cubes and vegetables, coat them well with the marinade, and let them rest for at least 30 minutes (or longer for better flavor). Thread the marinated paneer and vegetables onto skewers, alternating between them, and then grill in an oven at 200°C for 15–20 minutes, flipping halfway, or roast on a stovetop tawa until golden with slight char marks. Finally, brush lightly with butter or ghee, sprinkle some chaat masala, and serve hot with mint chutney, onion rings, and lemon wedges.
