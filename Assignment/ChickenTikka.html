            Chicken tikka is a popular Indian dish made by marinating boneless chicken pieces in a spiced yogurt mixture and grilling them until smoky and tender. To prepare, cut 500 grams of boneless chicken into medium cubes. In a bowl, make a marinade using ½ cup thick curd (yogurt), 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste, 1 ½ teaspoons red chili powder, ½ teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon cumin powder, 1 teaspoon coriander powder, 1 teaspoon garam masala, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon mustard oil (or regular oil), and salt to taste.

            Mix well and coat the chicken pieces in this marinade, then cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or overnight for best flavor). Thread the marinated chicken onto skewers and grill in a preheated oven at 200°C for 20–25 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden and slightly charred. Alternatively, you can cook them on a stovetop grill pan or tandoor. Finally, brush with butter or ghee, sprinkle a little chaat masala, and serve hot with green chutney, onion rings, and lemon wedges.
