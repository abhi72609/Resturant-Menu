            Chicken curry is a classic Indian dish made with tender chicken pieces simmered in a spiced onion-tomato gravy. To prepare, wash and clean 500 grams of chicken (bone-in or boneless as you prefer). Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan, add 1 bay leaf, 2–3 cloves, 2 cardamoms, and a small cinnamon stick, then let them splutter. Add 2 finely chopped onions and sauté until golden brown, then add 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste and cook until the raw smell goes away. Add 2 chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and oil separates. Mix in ½ teaspoon turmeric, 1 teaspoon red chili powder, 1 ½ teaspoons coriander powder, and 1 teaspoon garam masala.

            Now add the chicken pieces, salt, and stir well so they are coated with the masala. Cook for 5–7 minutes on medium flame, then add 1 cup of water (more if you want thinner curry) and cover to simmer for 15–20 minutes until the chicken is cooked and tender. Finally, add a handful of chopped coriander leaves, adjust seasoning, and let it rest for a couple of minutes. Serve the chicken curry hot with steamed rice, roti, or naan.
